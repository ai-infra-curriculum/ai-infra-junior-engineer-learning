## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Create Lecture 01 (Introduction to Linux and Command Line)

### Phase 2: üîÑ IN PROGRESS
Due to response length limitations, remaining lectures will be created in subsequent steps:

1. Create `02-file-system-navigation.md` (extract from old 01)
2. Rename `02-file-permissions.md` to `03-permissions-security.md`
3. Create `04-system-administration.md` (combine content from 03, 05, 06)
4. Split `04-shell-scripting.md` into:
   - `05-intro-shell-scripting.md`
   - `06-advanced-shell-scripting.md`
5. Create `07-text-processing.md` (new content from scratch)
6. Restructure `06-networking-system-services.md` to `08-networking.md`

### Phase 3: üîú CLEANUP
- Delete old lecture files after verification
- Update any internal cross-references
- Verify all 8 lectures are properly structured

## Quality Assurance Checklist

For each lecture, ensure:
- [ ] Consistent structure (TOC, Introduction, Learning Objectives, sections, Summary)
- [ ] AI Infrastructure focus throughout with relevant examples
- [ ] Code examples with explanations
- [ ] Hands-on labs or exercises
- [ ] 800-1400 lines per lecture (appropriate for 90-120 min)
- [ ] Clear learning progression
- [ ] Cross-references to related lectures
- [ ] Best practices sections
- [ ] Quick reference cards
- [ ] Practice exercises

## Benefits of Restructuring

1. **Better Learning Pace**: Split broad topics (Linux Fundamentals, Process Management) into manageable chunks
2. **Clearer Focus**: Each lecture has a distinct, well-defined topic
3. **Added Content**: New text processing lecture fills critical gap
4. **Logical Progression**: More natural flow from basic to advanced concepts
5. **Time Alignment**: Lectures properly sized for 90 or 120 minute sessions
6. **README Compliance**: Exactly matches what was promised to students

## Next Steps

1. Complete creation of remaining 7 lectures
2. Verify content quality and consistency
3. Test that all code examples work
4. Update cross-references between lectures
5. Delete old lecture files
6. Update module README if needed (shouldn't be necessary as structure now matches)

**Last Updated**: [Date]
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete (1/8 lectures created)
**Next Action**: Create Lecture 02 (File System and Navigation)
