# Module 006: Kubernetes Introduction

## Module Overview

Welcome to Module 006, where you'll learn the fundamentals of Kubernetes (K8s), the industry-standard container orchestration platform. This module provides a comprehensive introduction to Kubernetes architecture, core concepts, and practical operations essential for AI infrastructure work.

Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications, including ML models and AI workloads. Understanding Kubernetes is critical for any AI infrastructure engineer, as it provides the foundation for building scalable, resilient ML systems.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- **Understand Kubernetes Architecture**: Master the core components of Kubernetes including the control plane, worker nodes, and how they interact
- **Deploy Applications**: Create and manage Pods, Deployments, Services, and other Kubernetes resources
- **Use Helm**: Package and deploy applications using Helm charts
- **Operate Kubernetes Clusters**: Use kubectl effectively, debug issues, and monitor cluster health
- **Apply K8s to ML Workloads**: Understand how Kubernetes supports AI/ML infrastructure needs
