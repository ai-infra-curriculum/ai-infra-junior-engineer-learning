## 1. What is Cloud Computing?

### 1.1 Definition and Core Characteristics

**Cloud computing** is the on-demand delivery of compute, storage, databases, networking, software, and other IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

**Five Essential Characteristics** (per NIST definition):

1. **On-Demand Self-Service**: Provision resources automatically without human intervention from the provider
2. **Broad Network Access**: Services accessible over the network via standard mechanisms (web, API, CLI)
3. **Resource Pooling**: Provider's resources serve multiple customers using multi-tenant models
4. **Rapid Elasticity**: Scale resources up or down quickly, often automatically
5. **Measured Service**: Usage is monitored, controlled, and reported (pay for what you use)

**Example:** Instead of buying physical servers, you click a button (or run a CLI command) to launch a virtual machine in AWS that's billed by the hour. If you need 100 servers for a training job, you can spin them up in minutes and terminate them when done.

### 1.2 The Evolution of Cloud Computing

**Timeline:**

- **Pre-2000s**: On-premises data centers, capital expenditure (CapEx) heavy, slow provisioning
- **2006**: AWS launches EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud), democratizing access to compute
- **2008**: Google App Engine (PaaS), Microsoft Azure announced
- **2010s**: Explosion of cloud services (storage, databases, ML platforms, IoT, serverless)
- **2020s**: Multi-cloud, hybrid cloud, edge computing, cloud-native AI/ML platforms

**Key Drivers:**
- **Virtualization technology** matured (VMware, KVM, Xen) enabling efficient multi-tenancy
- **High-speed networking** made remote data centers viable
- **APIs and automation** enabled self-service provisioning
- **Open-source software** lowered costs and increased flexibility

### 1.3 Why Cloud Computing Matters for AI/ML

AI/ML workloads have unique characteristics that make cloud computing particularly valuable:

**1. Variable Compute Demands**
- Training: Massive compute for hours/days, then nothing
- Inference: Spiky traffic patterns based on user demand
- **Cloud solution**: Scale up for training, scale down to zero, auto-scale inference based on traffic

**2. Specialized Hardware Requirements**
- GPUs, TPUs, custom accelerators (AWS Inferentia, Google TPU)
- Expensive to purchase and maintain
- **Cloud solution**: Rent GPUs only when needed, access latest hardware without CapEx

**3. Experimentation and Iteration**
- Data scientists need to try different models, hyperparameters, datasets
- **Cloud solution**: Spin up multiple environments, run parallel experiments, pay only for usage

**4. Global Scale**
- ML models may serve users worldwide
- **Cloud solution**: Deploy to multiple regions, use CDNs, low-latency edge inference

**5. Managed ML Services**
- Cloud providers offer SageMaker (AWS), Vertex AI (GCP), Azure ML
- **Cloud solution**: Focus on modeling, not infrastructure plumbing

**Real-World Example:**
> OpenAI trained GPT-3 on thousands of GPUs in Azure for months. The cost would have been prohibitive with on-premises infrastructure, and the GPUs would sit idle post-training. Cloud enabled:
> - Burst to massive scale for training
> - Release GPUs after training
> - Global inference deployment via Azure regions
> - Managed infrastructure (Azure handles hardware failures, networking, security)

## 2. Cloud Service Models

Cloud services are categorized by the level of abstraction and control they provide.

### 2.1 Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

**Definition:** Rent virtualized compute, storage, and networking resources. You manage the OS, runtime, data, and applications.

**What You Control:**
- Operating system (Linux, Windows)
- Applications and middleware
- Runtime (Python, Node.js, Java)
- Data

**What Provider Controls:**
- Virtualization layer
- Physical servers, storage, networking
- Data center facilities

**Examples:**
- **AWS EC2**: Virtual machines in the cloud
- **Google Compute Engine**: VMs on Google infrastructure
- **Azure Virtual Machines**: Microsoft's VM offering

**Use Cases:**
- Lift-and-shift migrations (move existing apps to cloud)
- Custom configurations requiring OS-level control
- Legacy applications not designed for PaaS/SaaS

**Pros:**
- Maximum flexibility and control
- Can replicate on-premises environments
- Supports any software stack

**Cons:**
- You manage OS patches, security hardening, scaling
- More operational overhead than PaaS/SaaS

**Example Architecture:**
```
[Your Application]
    ↓
[Your Runtime (Python, CUDA)]
    ↓
[Your OS (Ubuntu 22.04)]
    ↓
[IaaS - AWS EC2 Instance]
    ↓
[AWS Hypervisor]
    ↓
[AWS Physical Hardware]
```

### 2.2 Platform as a Service (PaaS)

**Definition:** Provide a managed platform where you deploy applications without managing the underlying infrastructure.

**What You Control:**
- Application code
- Data
- Configuration

**What Provider Controls:**
- Operating system
- Runtime and frameworks
- Middleware, databases
- Servers, storage, networking

**Examples:**
- **Google App Engine**: Deploy apps, Google handles scaling
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: Deploy web apps, AWS manages servers
- **Heroku**: Git push to deploy, fully managed
- **Azure App Service**: Managed web app hosting

**Use Cases:**
- Web applications, APIs, microservices
- Focus on code, not infrastructure
- Rapid development and deployment

**Pros:**
- Faster development (no server management)
- Auto-scaling, load balancing built-in
- Reduced operational complexity

**Cons:**
- Less control (can't customize OS)
- Vendor lock-in (tied to platform APIs)
- May not support all frameworks/languages

**Example Workflow:**
```bash
# Deploy to Google App Engine
gcloud app deploy app.yaml

# Google automatically:
# - Provisions servers
# - Configures load balancer
# - Auto-scales based on traffic
# - Manages OS updates
```

### 2.3 Software as a Service (SaaS)

**Definition:** Fully managed applications accessed over the internet. You consume the software; provider manages everything.

**What You Control:**
- User data
- Configuration settings

**What Provider Controls:**
- Everything else (application, runtime, OS, infrastructure)

**Examples:**
- **Google Workspace** (Gmail, Docs, Sheets): Productivity suite
- **Salesforce**: CRM platform
- **Slack**: Team collaboration
- **Snowflake**: Data warehouse (SaaS model for databases)

**Use Cases:**
- Standard business applications
- No desire to manage infrastructure
- Pay per user/seat

**Pros:**
- Zero infrastructure management
- Accessible from anywhere
- Automatic updates and patches

**Cons:**
- Minimal customization
- Data residency concerns
- Vendor lock-in

**Example:** Instead of hosting your own email server (Exchange), use Gmail. Google manages servers, spam filtering, backups, security patches.

### 2.4 Function as a Service (FaaS) / Serverless

**Definition:** Execute code in response to events without provisioning servers. Pay only for execution time.

**What You Control:**
- Function code (Python, Node.js, Go, etc.)
- Triggers and event sources

**What Provider Controls:**
- Runtime environment
- Scaling, availability, infrastructure

**Examples:**
- **AWS Lambda**: Run code in response to events (S3 uploads, API Gateway requests)
- **Google Cloud Functions**: Event-driven functions
- **Azure Functions**: Serverless compute

**Use Cases:**
- Event-driven workflows (process uploaded images, trigger on database changes)
- Batch processing (transform data files)
- Inference serving (lightweight models)
- Backend APIs (REST endpoints)

**Pros:**
- Extreme cost efficiency (pay per invocation, down to millisecond granularity)
- Auto-scaling to zero (no cost when idle)
- No server management

**Cons:**
- Cold starts (initial invocation delay)
- Execution time limits (AWS Lambda: 15 minutes max)
- State management challenges (functions are stateless)

**Example Lambda Function:**
```python
# AWS Lambda function to resize images uploaded to S3
import boto3
from PIL import Image

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Event triggered when image uploaded to S3
    bucket = event['Records'][0]['s3']['bucket']['name']
    key = event['Records'][0]['s3']['object']['key']

    # Download image, resize, upload to new bucket
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    img = Image.open(s3.get_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=key)['Body'])
    img.thumbnail((200, 200))
    # Upload resized image...

    return {'statusCode': 200, 'body': 'Image resized'}
```

**When Lambda is invoked:**
- AWS provisions a container, runs your code, returns result
- You're billed for execution time (rounded to nearest 1ms)
- Container may be reused for subsequent invocations (warm start)

### 2.5 Choosing the Right Service Model

| Criterion | IaaS | PaaS | SaaS | FaaS |
|-----------|------|------|------|------|
| **Control** | High | Medium | Low | Medium |
| **Flexibility** | High | Medium | Low | High (for code) |
| **Management Overhead** | High | Low | None | Very Low |
| **Time to Deploy** | Days-Weeks | Hours-Days | Minutes | Minutes |
| **Scalability** | Manual/Auto (you configure) | Auto (platform handles) | Auto (provider handles) | Auto (infinite scale) |
| **Cost Model** | Pay for instances (hourly) | Pay for apps/usage | Pay per user/seat | Pay per invocation |
| **Best For** | Custom stacks, legacy apps | Web apps, APIs | Business apps | Event-driven, batch |

**Decision Tree:**
- **Need OS-level control?** → IaaS
- **Building web app/API, want less ops?** → PaaS
- **Using standard business software?** → SaaS
- **Event-driven, unpredictable traffic?** → FaaS

**For AI/ML:**
- **Training large models:** IaaS (EC2 with GPUs) or managed services (SageMaker)
- **Model serving (high throughput):** IaaS (ECS/EKS with GPUs)
- **Model serving (light, event-driven):** FaaS (Lambda with container support)
- **End-to-end ML platform:** PaaS/SaaS (SageMaker, Vertex AI)

## 3. Cloud Deployment Models

How and where cloud infrastructure is deployed affects cost, control, compliance, and performance.

### 3.1 Public Cloud

**Definition:** Cloud infrastructure owned and operated by a third-party provider, shared among multiple customers (multi-tenancy).

**Examples:** AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud

**Characteristics:**
- **Shared Infrastructure**: Resources are pooled and dynamically allocated
- **Internet Access**: Accessed over public internet (or dedicated connections like AWS Direct Connect)
- **Pay-as-you-go**: No upfront CapEx, operational expense (OpEx) model

**Pros:**
- **No CapEx**: No hardware to buy
- **Elasticity**: Scale to thousands of servers instantly
- **Global Reach**: Regions worldwide
- **Innovation**: Access latest services (ML, serverless, databases)

**Cons:**
- **Data Residency**: Data stored in provider's data centers (compliance concerns)
- **Vendor Lock-In**: Tight integration with provider services
- **Internet Dependency**: Requires network connectivity

**Use Cases:**
- Startups and SMBs (no upfront investment)
- Variable workloads (ML training, web apps)
- Global applications

### 3.2 Private Cloud

**Definition:** Cloud infrastructure dedicated to a single organization, hosted on-premises or by a third party.

**Examples:**
- **OpenStack**: Open-source private cloud platform
- **VMware vSphere**: Virtualization platform for private clouds
- **AWS Outposts**: AWS infrastructure in your data center

**Characteristics:**
- **Dedicated Resources**: Not shared with other organizations
- **On-Premises or Hosted**: Can be in your data center or provider's facility
- **Custom Security**: Full control over security policies

**Pros:**
- **Control**: Complete control over infrastructure
- **Compliance**: Easier to meet regulatory requirements (data never leaves your premises)
- **Performance**: Predictable performance (no noisy neighbors)

**Cons:**
- **High CapEx**: Must purchase hardware
- **Limited Elasticity**: Scaling constrained by owned capacity
- **Operational Overhead**: Manage infrastructure team

**Use Cases:**
- Financial services, healthcare (strict compliance)
- Government agencies
- Organizations with sensitive data

### 3.3 Hybrid Cloud

**Definition:** Combination of public and private clouds, interconnected to allow data and application portability.

**Example Architectures:**
- **Sensitive data in private cloud**, general workloads in public cloud
- **Development/test in public cloud**, production in private cloud
- **Bursting**: Run on-premises normally, burst to public cloud for spikes

**Technologies:**
- **AWS Outposts**: Extends AWS services into your data center
- **Azure Arc**: Manage Azure services across on-premises, multi-cloud
- **Google Anthos**: Kubernetes-based multi-cloud platform
- **VPN/Direct Connect**: Secure connectivity between environments

**Pros:**
- **Flexibility**: Best of both worlds
- **Cost Optimization**: Use public cloud for variable workloads, private for steady-state
- **Compliance**: Keep sensitive data on-premises

**Cons:**
- **Complexity**: Managing two environments
- **Integration Challenges**: Data synchronization, networking
- **Cost**: May pay for both environments

**Use Case Example (Healthcare):**
- **Private Cloud**: Patient health records (HIPAA compliance, sensitive data)
- **Public Cloud (AWS)**: ML model training on anonymized data, inference APIs
- **Hybrid Connectivity**: VPN tunnel, data sync for model updates

### 3.4 Multi-Cloud

**Definition:** Using services from multiple public cloud providers (AWS + GCP + Azure).

**Motivations:**
- **Avoid Vendor Lock-In**: Reduce dependency on single provider
- **Best-of-Breed Services**: Use AWS for EC2, GCP for BigQuery, Azure for Active Directory
- **Geographic Coverage**: Some providers have better presence in certain regions
- **Negotiating Power**: Leverage competition for pricing

**Challenges:**
- **Complexity**: Different APIs, tools, billing systems
- **Data Transfer Costs**: Moving data between clouds is expensive
- **Skills Gap**: Team must know multiple platforms
- **Operational Overhead**: Manage multiple consoles, CLIs, IAM systems

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Abstraction Layers**: Use Kubernetes (runs anywhere), Terraform (IaC for all clouds)
- **Service Mesh**: Istio, Linkerd for cross-cloud networking
- **Centralized Observability**: Datadog, New Relic work across clouds

**Example Multi-Cloud Architecture:**
```
AWS:
  - EC2 for compute
  - S3 for data lake
  - SageMaker for model training

GCP:
  - BigQuery for analytics
  - Vertex AI for AutoML

Azure:
  - Active Directory for identity
  - Azure Functions for event processing

Connection: VPN/Peering between VPCs
Orchestration: Terraform manages all three
Monitoring: Datadog aggregates metrics from all providers
```

### 3.5 Edge and Fog Computing

**Edge Computing:** Processing data near the source (e.g., IoT devices, factories) rather than in central cloud data centers.

**Why?**
- **Latency**: Autonomous vehicles can't wait for round-trip to AWS (milliseconds matter)
- **Bandwidth**: Sending terabytes of video to cloud is expensive
- **Privacy**: Process sensitive data locally
- **Reliability**: Work offline if internet fails

**Examples:**
- **AWS Greengrass**: Run Lambda functions on edge devices
- **Azure IoT Edge**: Deploy containers to edge
- **Google Cloud IoT Edge**: ML inference on edge devices

**AI/ML Use Case:** Deploy trained model to edge device (smartphone, camera) for real-time inference, send only aggregated data or model updates to cloud.

## 5. Cloud Economics and FinOps

### 5.1 Why Cloud is Cost-Effective (When Done Right)

**Traditional On-Premises Costs:**
- **Hardware CapEx**: Servers, storage, networking gear ($50K-$500K+ upfront)
- **Data Center**: Power, cooling, physical security, rent
- **Staff**: Admins, network engineers, security team
- **Overprovisioning**: Must buy for peak capacity (sits idle 80% of time)
- **Depreciation**: Hardware loses value, needs replacement every 3-5 years

**Cloud Costs (OpEx Model):**
- **Pay-as-you-go**: Pay only for what you use
- **Elasticity**: Scale down when idle (ML training: scale to zero after job completes)
- **No Data Center**: Provider handles facilities, power, cooling
- **Shared Staff**: Provider's team manages hardware, you focus on apps

**Break-Even Example:**
- **On-Prem**: $100K servers + $20K/year operations = $100K + $100K over 5 years = $200K
- **Cloud**: $3K/month for equivalent capacity = $180K over 5 years
- **But**: Cloud scales down to $500/month when idle = $90K over 5 years (55% savings)

**Key Insight:** Cloud wins when workloads are **variable**. For steady-state 24/7 workloads, on-prem may be cheaper.

### 5.2 Cloud Pricing Models Explained

**1. On-Demand Pricing**
- **Pay per hour/second** for resources
- **No commitment**, start/stop anytime
- **Most expensive**, but most flexible
- **Use case**: Development, testing, unpredictable workloads

**2. Reserved Instances / Committed Use**
- **1-3 year commitment** to specific instance type/region
- **Up to 72% discount** vs on-demand
- **Payment options**: All upfront (max discount), partial upfront, no upfront
- **Use case**: Predictable baseline workload (database server running 24/7)

**3. Spot / Preemptible Instances**
- **Bid on spare capacity**, up to 90% discount
- **Can be terminated** with 2-minute notice (AWS) or 30 seconds (GCP)
- **Use case**: Fault-tolerant workloads (batch processing, ML training with checkpointing)

**4. Savings Plans (AWS)**
- **Commit to $/hour** of usage (e.g., $100/hour) for 1-3 years
- **Flexible**: Can change instance types, regions
- **Up to 72% discount**
- **Use case**: Broad commitment without locking to specific instances

**Example Pricing (AWS EC2 p3.2xlarge, 1 GPU):**
- **On-Demand**: $3.06/hour = $2,200/month if run 24/7
- **1-Year Reserved**: $1.40/hour = $1,008/month (54% savings)
- **3-Year Reserved**: $0.93/hour = $670/month (70% savings)
- **Spot**: $0.92/hour = $662/month (70% savings, interruptible)

### 5.3 Common Cost Pitfalls

**1. Idle Resources**
- **Problem**: Developers launch instances for testing, forget to terminate
- **Solution**: Tagging policies, auto-shutdown schedules, cost alerts

**2. Data Transfer (Egress Fees)**
- **Problem**: Data OUT of cloud is expensive ($0.09/GB in AWS)
- **Scenario**: Training on 10TB dataset, pulling results to on-prem = $900 egress fee
- **Solution**: Process data in cloud, only transfer results; use AWS S3 Transfer Acceleration

**3. Over-Provisioning**
- **Problem**: Launch largest instance "to be safe"
- **Solution**: Start small, monitor, right-size based on metrics

**4. Wrong Pricing Model**
- **Problem**: Running 24/7 database on on-demand pricing
- **Solution**: Buy reserved instances for baseline, use spot for variable load

**5. Lack of Visibility**
- **Problem**: No one knows where costs come from
- **Solution**: Cost allocation tags, AWS Cost Explorer, Billing alerts

### 5.4 FinOps Best Practices

**FinOps** = Financial Operations for Cloud. Brings finance, engineering, and business together to optimize cloud spending.

**Core Practices:**

**1. Visibility**
- **Tag everything**: Owner, project, environment, cost center
- **Use Cost Explorer**: Drill down by service, region, tag
- **Set up billing dashboards**: Real-time cost visibility

**2. Optimization**
- **Right-sizing**: Match instance size to actual usage (downsize over-provisioned)
- **Reserved/Spot instances**: For predictable/flexible workloads
- **Auto-scaling**: Scale down during off-hours
- **S3 storage classes**: Move infrequent data to Glacier (99% cost reduction)

**3. Governance**
- **Budgets and alerts**: Alert when spending exceeds threshold
- **Spending limits**: Prevent runaway costs (set budget caps)
- **Approval workflows**: Require approval for large instance types

**4. Accountability**
- **Chargeback**: Allocate costs back to teams based on tags
- **Cost reviews**: Monthly reviews with teams
- **Cost KPIs**: Track cost per user, cost per request, cost per model training run

**Example Cost Optimization:**
```
Initial State:
  - 10 x EC2 m5.large instances (on-demand, 24/7)
  - Cost: $700/month

After Optimization:
  - 3 x Reserved instances (baseline, 24/7): $210/month
  - 7 x Auto-scaling group (scale down at night): $350/month average
  - Savings: $140/month (20%)

After Further Optimization:
  - Move dev/test to spot instances: -$100/month
  - Right-size (some workloads only need m5.small): -$80/month
  - Final cost: $380/month (46% savings)
```

## 6. Cloud Architecture Principles

### 6.1 Design for Failure

**Traditional Mindset:** Build resilient servers, hope they don't fail.
**Cloud Mindset:** Assume everything fails, design for resilience.

**Principles:**

**1. Redundancy**
- **Multiple Availability Zones**: Deploy across 2-3 AZs in a region
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic, auto-detect failures
- **Database Replication**: Multi-AZ RDS, read replicas

**2. Health Checks and Auto-Recovery**
- **EC2 Auto Recovery**: Automatically restart failed instances
- **ECS/Kubernetes**: Replace failed containers
- **Route 53 Health Checks**: Failover DNS to healthy region

**3. Graceful Degradation**
- **Circuit Breakers**: Stop calling failed service, return cached/default response
- **Fallback**: If recommendation API fails, show popular items

**Example:**
```
User Request → Load Balancer
                  ├─> App Server 1 (AZ-A) ✓
                  ├─> App Server 2 (AZ-B) ✗ (failed, LB stops routing here)
                  └─> App Server 3 (AZ-C) ✓

Auto-Scaling Group detects failure → Launches replacement in AZ-B
```

### 6.2 Scalability and Elasticity

**Scalability:** Ability to handle increased load.
**Elasticity:** Ability to scale up AND down automatically.

**Vertical Scaling (Scale Up):** Increase instance size (t2.micro → t2.large)
- **Pros**: Simple, no code changes
- **Cons**: Downtime to resize, limited by largest instance size

**Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out):** Add more instances
- **Pros**: No downtime, near-infinite scale
- **Cons**: Requires stateless design, load balancing

**Auto-Scaling:**
- **Metric-based**: Scale when CPU > 70% for 5 minutes
- **Schedule-based**: Scale up at 9am, down at 6pm
- **Predictive**: ML-based prediction of traffic patterns

**Example Auto-Scaling Policy:**
```yaml
# AWS Auto-Scaling Group
ScalingPolicy:
  TargetTrackingScaling:
    TargetValue: 70  # Keep CPU at 70%
    ScaleInCooldown: 300  # Wait 5min before scaling down
    ScaleOutCooldown: 60  # Wait 1min before scaling up
```

### 6.3 Loose Coupling and Microservices

**Tight Coupling (Monolith):**
```
[Web UI] ← → [Business Logic] ← → [Database]
(Single application, one failure crashes everything)
```

**Loose Coupling (Microservices):**
```
[Web UI] → [API Gateway]
              ├─> [User Service] → [User DB]
              ├─> [Inference Service] → [Model Storage]
              └─> [Analytics Service] → [Data Warehouse]

(Independent services, communicate via APIs, failures isolated)
```

**Benefits:**
- **Independent Scaling**: Scale inference service independently
- **Independent Deployment**: Deploy new model without touching user service
- **Fault Isolation**: Inference failure doesn't crash analytics

**Technologies:**
- **API Gateway**: AWS API Gateway, Kong, Nginx
- **Service Mesh**: Istio, Linkerd (for service-to-service communication)
- **Message Queues**: SQS, Pub/Sub (async communication)

### 6.4 Statelessness

**Stateful Server (Bad):**
```python
# Server stores session in memory
sessions = {}

@app.route('/login')
def login():
    sessions[user_id] = session_data  # Problem: only on this server!
```

**Problem**: User's next request may hit different server, session lost.

**Stateless Server (Good):**
```python
# Store session in external store (Redis, DynamoDB)
@app.route('/login')
def login():
    redis.set(user_id, session_data)  # All servers access same Redis
```

**Benefits:**
- **Any server can handle any request**
- **Easy to scale horizontally**
- **Servers disposable** (can be replaced anytime)

**For ML Inference:**
- **Model loaded from S3/EFS**, not bundled in image (allows quick updates)
- **Request state in database**, not in-memory
- **GPUs stateless**: Any inference request can run on any GPU instance

### 6.5 Security Best Practices

**1. Least Privilege (IAM)**
- Grant minimum permissions required
- Use IAM roles (not access keys)
- Enable MFA for sensitive operations

**2. Defense in Depth**
- **Multiple layers**: Firewall, security groups, application auth, encryption
- **WAF (Web Application Firewall)**: Block SQL injection, XSS attacks

**3. Encryption**
- **At Rest**: Encrypt S3 buckets, EBS volumes, RDS databases
- **In Transit**: HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- **Key Management**: Use KMS (Key Management Service), rotate keys

**4. Network Segmentation**
- **Public Subnet**: Load balancers, bastions (internet-facing)
- **Private Subnet**: Application servers (no direct internet access)
- **Data Subnet**: Databases (no internet, only accessible from app subnet)

**5. Monitoring and Logging**
- **CloudTrail**: Log all API calls (who did what, when)
- **GuardDuty**: Threat detection (suspicious activity)
- **Config**: Track resource configuration changes

**Example Secure Architecture:**
```
Internet
  ↓
[WAF] → [ALB in Public Subnet]
           ↓
       [App Servers in Private Subnet]
           ↓
       [RDS in Data Subnet (no internet)]

Security Groups:
  - ALB: Allow 443 from internet
  - App: Allow traffic only from ALB security group
  - RDS: Allow traffic only from App security group
```

## 7. Cloud-Native Technologies

### 7.1 Containers and Kubernetes

**Containers (Docker):** Package application + dependencies in isolated runtime environment.

**Why Containers in Cloud?**
- **Consistent environments**: Dev = Staging = Production
- **Fast startup**: Seconds vs minutes for VMs
- **Efficient resource usage**: Share OS kernel, lighter than VMs

**Kubernetes:** Container orchestration platform for deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications.

**Cloud Kubernetes Services:**
- **AWS EKS** (Elastic Kubernetes Service): Managed Kubernetes on AWS
- **GCP GKE** (Google Kubernetes Engine): Google's managed Kubernetes
- **Azure AKS** (Azure Kubernetes Service): Microsoft's managed Kubernetes

**Benefits for AI/ML:**
- **GPU Sharing**: Multiple containers share GPU
- **Model Serving**: Deploy models as containers, Kubernetes handles scaling
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Kubeflow for ML pipelines on Kubernetes

### 7.2 Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

**Problem:** Clicking in console is error-prone, not repeatable.
**Solution:** Define infrastructure in code, version control it, review changes.

**Tools:**
- **Terraform**: Multi-cloud IaC (works with AWS, GCP, Azure)
- **AWS CloudFormation**: AWS-specific IaC
- **Pulumi**: IaC in Python, TypeScript, Go

**Example Terraform:**
```hcl
# Define EC2 instance
resource "aws_instance" "ml_server" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "p3.2xlarge"  # GPU instance

  tags = {
    Name = "ml-training-server"
    Environment = "production"
  }
}

# Apply: terraform apply
# Infrastructure is created from code, can be reviewed in Git
```

**Benefits:**
- **Version Control**: Track infrastructure changes in Git
- **Peer Review**: Code review before deploying infrastructure
- **Repeatability**: Deploy identical environments (dev, staging, prod)
- **Documentation**: Code IS the documentation

### 7.3 Serverless Architectures

**Serverless = No server management** (not literally no servers).

**Components:**
- **Functions**: AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions
- **Storage**: S3, DynamoDB
- **API Gateway**: Expose functions as REST APIs
- **Event Sources**: S3 uploads, database changes, schedules

**Example Serverless ML Inference:**
```
User Request → API Gateway
                 ↓
              Lambda Function
                 ↓ (loads model from S3)
              [Model Inference]
                 ↓
              Return Prediction

Cost: $0.20 per 1M requests + compute time
      (vs $100/month for always-on EC2)
```

**When Serverless Works:**
- **Low/Variable Traffic**: Cost-effective for sporadic usage
- **Event-Driven**: Respond to events (file uploads, webhooks)
- **Lightweight Models**: Fits in memory, runs in < 15 minutes

**When Serverless Doesn't Work:**
- **Large Models**: > 10GB doesn't fit in Lambda
- **Long-Running**: Training jobs > 15 minutes
- **High Throughput**: Cold starts hurt latency

## 8. Key Takeaways

1. **Cloud computing** provides on-demand, scalable infrastructure with pay-as-you-go pricing—ideal for variable AI/ML workloads.

2. **Service models** (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, FaaS) offer different trade-offs between control and convenience. Choose based on your needs.

3. **AWS** has the broadest service catalog, **GCP** excels at data/ML, **Azure** integrates with Microsoft ecosystem. Multi-cloud is complex but reduces lock-in.

4. **FinOps** is critical: Tag resources, use reserved/spot instances, right-size, monitor costs continuously.

5. **Design for failure**: Use multiple AZs, load balancers, auto-scaling. Cloud infrastructure is ephemeral and resilient.

6. **Cloud-native technologies** (containers, Kubernetes, serverless, IaC) maximize cloud benefits and enable DevOps/MLOps practices.

7. For **AI/ML**, cloud enables:
   - Elastic compute for training (scale to 1000s of GPUs, pay only for training time)
   - Global inference deployment (low-latency serving in multiple regions)
   - Managed ML platforms (SageMaker, Vertex AI) reducing operational overhead
   - Cost efficiency (pay for what you use, no idle GPUs)
