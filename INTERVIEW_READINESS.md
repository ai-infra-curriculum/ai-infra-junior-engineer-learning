# Interview Readiness Guide – AI Infrastructure Junior Engineer

## Purpose
Use this guide to translate the repository’s modules into mock-interview practice. It emphasises hands-on storytelling and repeatable drills rather than new curriculum content.

## Core Competencies to Highlight
- Environment automation and shell fluency  
- Git/GitHub workflows and review etiquette  
- Introductory observability, logging, and runbook hygiene  
- Basic containerisation and deployment safety

## Preparation Checklist
1. **Review Modules:** Skim each module README and note the labs that demonstrate the competencies above.  
2. **Select Stories:** Pick three STAR-formatted anecdotes (Situation, Task, Action, Result) aligned with environment setup, GitOps, and containerisation.  
3. **Portfolio Proof:** Prepare links to relevant repo folders, especially `lessons/` exercises and completed projects.  
4. **Practice Out Loud:** Rehearse answers focusing on clarity, trade-offs, and collaboration moments.

## Mock Interview Structure (30 minutes)
| Segment | Objective | Resources |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5 min | Personal intro + motivation | Module overviews |
| 10 min | Technical walkthrough (pick one lab) | Exercise folders |
| 10 min | Troubleshooting scenario | Incident-style reflections from projects |
| 5 min | Questions for interviewer | Prepared list (see below) |

## Sample Technical Prompts
- “Walk me through how you bootstrap a development environment for a new ML service.”  
- “Explain your Git branching model and how you handle hotfixes.”  
- “Describe a time you improved an onboarding process or runbook.”

Tie responses back to specific exercises or project scaffolds, referencing file paths when possible.

## Behavioral Prompts
- Conflict resolution during code reviews  
- Learning from an outage or failed deployment  
- Communicating status to senior team members

## Questions to Ask the Interviewer
- “How do junior infra engineers collaborate with data science teams here?”  
- “What tooling or checklists do you use for new environment provisioning?”  
- “How do you mentor new hires on GitOps expectations?”

## Next Steps
Track interview readiness tasks in `/progress/` or personal notes, and update this template with customised stories once you complete additional labs.***
