## Preparing for Office Hours

### Come Prepared

To get the most value:

1. **Have specific questions**:
   - ✓ "My Docker container exits with code 137. I've tried X and Y."

2. **Share context**:
   - What module/project are you on?
   - What have you tried?
   - Error messages (copy-paste, don't screenshot)
   - Relevant code snippets

3. **Be ready to share screen**:
   - Have your code open
   - Terminal with error messages visible
   - Browser with relevant tabs

4. **Prepare a fallback question**:
   - In case your main question is answered quickly
   - Or if other questions run long

### What to Bring

**For Technical Questions**:
- Link to your code (GitHub repo)
- Error messages (text, not screenshots)
- Description of expected vs. actual behavior
- What you've already tried

**For Project Review**:
- GitHub repository link
- Specific areas you want feedback on
- Self-assessment completed
