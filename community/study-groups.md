## Starting Your Own Study Group

### Step 1: Define Your Group

**Group Size**: 3-6 people (ideal)
- Too small: Loss of diversity
- Too large: Hard to coordinate

**Time Commitment**: Set clear expectations
- Example: 2 meetings/week, 1-2 hours each
- Minimum 4-6 week commitment

**Goals**:
- Complete the curriculum
- Support each other
- Share resources
- Practice interviewing

**Level**:
- All beginners
- Mixed levels (junior + intermediate)
- Same starting point in curriculum

### Step 2: Find Members

**Where to post**:
```
🔍 Looking for Study Group Members!

I'm starting a study group for the Junior AI Infrastructure
Engineer curriculum. We'll meet 2x/week for 2 hours to:
- Work through lessons together
- Help each other with projects
- Practice interview questions

Looking for 3-5 committed learners who:
✓ Have basic Python knowledge
✓ Can commit to 10+ hrs/week
✓ Are starting or in first month of curriculum
✓ Want accountability and support

Meetings: Tue/Thu 7-9pm EST (flexible)
Platform: Discord + Zoom
Start date: [Date]

Interested? DM me or comment below!
```

**Screening questions**:
- Current skill level?
- Time commitment possible?
- Learning goals?
- Timezone?
- Preferred meeting times?

### Step 3: Set Up Infrastructure

**Communication**:
- Discord (recommended) - persistent chat, voice, screen share
- Slack - good for organized discussions
- WhatsApp/Telegram - simpler but less feature-rich

**Video calls**:
- Zoom (free tier: 40 min limit)
- Google Meet
- Discord video

**Code sharing**:
- GitHub organization
- Shared Google Drive
- Notion workspace

**Scheduling**:
- When2meet.com - find common availability
- Google Calendar - shared calendar
- Doodle - poll for meeting times

### Step 4: Structure Your Meetings

#### Weekly Structure Example

## Handling Common Challenges

### Challenge: Unequal Participation

**Solutions**:
- Mixed-level pairing (mentor/mentee)
- Flexible agendas accommodating all levels
- Extra resources for those behind
- Advanced challenges for those ahead
- Celebrate all progress, not just speed

---

### Challenge: Scheduling Conflicts

**Problem**: Hard to find common time

**Solutions**:
- Record sessions for absent members
- Async options (Discord discussions)
- Rotating meeting times
- Smaller breakout study sessions
- Weekend marathon sessions occasionally

---

### Challenge: Declining Attendance

**Problem**: Members stop showing up

**Solutions**:
- Check in individually
- Reassess group goals/schedule
- Make meetings more engaging
- Add social element (casual hangouts)
- Accept some attrition as normal

---

### Challenge: Toxic Behavior

**Problem**: Member is negative, overly critical, or disruptive

**Solutions**:
- Address privately first
- Revisit ground rules
- Document concerns
- Remove if necessary (majority vote)
