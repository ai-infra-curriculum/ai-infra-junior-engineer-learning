# Project Assessment Rubrics

## Overview

This document provides detailed rubrics for assessing all five projects in the Junior AI Infrastructure Engineer curriculum. Each rubric breaks down evaluation criteria into four main categories:

1. **Functionality (40%)** - Does it work correctly?
2. **Code Quality (25%)** - Is the code well-written and maintainable?
3. **Documentation (20%)** - Is the project well-documented?
4. **Best Practices (15%)** - Does it follow industry standards?

### Scoring Scale (1-5 per criterion)

- **5 - Exceptional**: Significantly exceeds requirements, demonstrates advanced understanding
- **4 - Proficient**: Fully meets requirements with professional quality
- **3 - Adequate**: Meets basic requirements, some improvements possible
- **2 - Developing**: Partially meets requirements, significant gaps present
- **1 - Insufficient**: Does not meet requirements, major issues present

### Minimum Passing Score: 75% (3.75/5.00 average)

4. **Calculate totals** for each category
5. **Identify gaps** where score < 4
6. **Make improvements** before final submission
7. **Retest and reverify** all functionality
8. **Document your work** thoroughly

## Getting Feedback

For peer or mentor review:
