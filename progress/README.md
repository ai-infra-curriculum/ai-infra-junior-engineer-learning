## Measuring Progress

### Completion Metrics

**Module Completion**:
```
Completion % = (Lessons Completed / Total Lessons) × 100
```

**Project Completion**:
```
Completion % = (Requirements Met / Total Requirements) × 100
```

**Overall Progress**:
```
Overall % = (Weighted Module % + Weighted Project % + Weighted Assessment %) / 3
```

### Understanding Levels

Use this scale to rate your understanding:

1. **Novice** (1/5): Aware of concept, need significant help
2. **Beginner** (2/5): Basic understanding, can follow tutorials
3. **Competent** (3/5): Can work independently with occasional help
4. **Proficient** (4/5): Deep understanding, can teach others
5. **Expert** (5/5): Mastery, can handle complex scenarios

### Time Tracking

Track time to:
- Estimate future learning
- Identify time-consuming topics
