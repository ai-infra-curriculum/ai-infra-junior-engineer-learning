# Module 009 Validation Prep Notes

## Completion Snapshot
- **Lectures:** 4/4 authored and aligned with Module README learning objectives.
- **Exercises:** 5/5 hands-on labs published (`lessons/mod-009-monitoring-basics/exercises/`).
- **Quiz:** 30-question knowledge check delivered (`quizzes/quiz-01-monitoring-observability.md`).
- **Resource Pack:** Index created (`resources/module-009-resource-pack.md`) â€“ assets still need population during repository implementation.

## Outstanding Deliverables for QA
| Area | Status | Next Owner | Notes |
|------|--------|------------|-------|
| Grafana dashboards & exports | Pending | repo-learning-agent / repo-solutions-agent | Generate JSON exports once dashboards are implemented; update resource pack. |
| Prometheus & logging configs | Pending | repo implementations | Compose/Helm files and rules referenced in exercises need canonical versions saved. |
| Runbooks & incident timelines | Pending | content-completion-agent (future pass) | Exercises specify runbooks; create actual markdown files before QA sign-off. |
| Validation checklist | Pending | qa-agent | Produce `validations/module-009-checklist.md` summarizing structural/content checks. |

## Suggested QA Focus
1. **Exercise Traceability:** Ensure each exercise references real files/templates once repos exist (e.g., assets directories, config scaffolds).
2. **Content Depth:** Spot-check lecture/exercise alignment with Module README objectives (metrics, logging, alerting, ML monitoring).
3. **Quiz Integrity:** Validate question coverage and difficulty; confirm solutions repo includes answer key.
4. **Resource Pack Coverage:** Verify all required supplementary assets are attached or clearly deferred with owner/ETA.

## Risks / Callouts
- Asset placeholders may cause confusion if not filled before learners access module. Coordinate with repo creation phases to populate quickly.
- Logging and Prometheus configurations should be tested end-to-end to avoid drift between documented steps and actual scripts.
- Alerting workflow depends on environment-specific credentials; include redaction guidance when exporting configs.

## Next Actions
1. Populate resource pack items during repository build sessions (use TODO notes as checklist).
2. Schedule QA/content-validation pass once assets exist; update validation checklist accordingly.
3. After QA approval, update memory to mark Module 009 as complete and shift focus to Module 010.
